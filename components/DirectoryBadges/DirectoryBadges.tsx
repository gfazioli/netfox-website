 * The badges of the directories Netfox is listed on (`config.directoryBadges`)
 * that go in one place: under the hero, or in the footer's "Listed on" row
 * (`ListedOn`). Nothing at all when none goes there. Ported from findergit.app,
 * like the rest of this folder.
 *
 * Lazy, unlike the rest of the hero: React 19 preloads, at the top of the
 * document, every `<img>` the server renders without `loading="lazy"`, and an
 * eager badge was fetched beside the hero's logo while it sat under the fold
 * on a laptop and on a phone alike (2026-09-29 audit). A lazy image near the
 * viewport is still fetched as soon as the page is laid out; it is just no
 * longer queued ahead of what the hero is made of.
 *
 * The links carry no `nofollow`, `sponsored` or `ugc`: a directory that checks
 * its backlink refuses a link marked with any of them. And no `noreferrer`,
 * the site's usual pairing: a directory counts the visits it sends, and not
 * every link here has UTM parameters to count them by.
 *
 * Style props (`mt`, ...) pass through; a `className` is not taken, since the
 * row's own class would replace it.
