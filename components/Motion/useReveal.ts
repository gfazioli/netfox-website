/**
 * Three states, and nothing is hidden in the first. At REST the element is
 * where the layout put it: that is the served HTML, and it is what stays when
 * the scripts never run -- a blocked chunk, a runtime error, a slow phone
 * still hydrating -- so a failure costs the motion and never the content. Once
 * mounted, an element that is entirely off screen is ARMED, parked in its
 * starting pose where nobody sees it park, and REVEALED the first time it
 * comes into view. What is on screen when the page mounts is never armed, so
 * it never moves.
 *
 * One-shot: scrolling back up never replays a section. Where there is no
 * IntersectionObserver (jsdom, very old browsers) nothing is ever armed.
 *
 * `threshold` is 0 by default: the bottom margin already starts a reveal a
 * little inside the viewport, and any share above 0 is a height some scope can
 * never reach -- at 0.15, one taller than about six viewports stays hidden for
 * good, which the FAQ is at 500% zoom.
 *
 * Cross-ported back from lancetta.app (its #59), which took the first version
 * from here and found what hiding from the first paint costs.
